    ?[GRBD]Mya Rose[GRBD]?: A song may only be up to 7 mins max otherwise time must be authorized by staff. (Moderator, etc.)
    [VIP] AMß?A?ITUS: There's no mod around, and if it's just a little less than 10 min it should be cool
    ?[GRBD]Mya Rose[GRBD]?: Raexas
    ?[GRBD]Mya Rose[GRBD]?: Wanna become my fan guys? I need some more.
    [VIP] AMß?A?ITUS: I don't think Kipling or anybody else will be mad

    [VIP] AMß?A?ITUS: If I played Calvertron or Schoolboy at my local night club, people would throw drinks at me

    [VIP] AMß?A?ITUS: @[VIDJ] The Real mGurtZ Eternal, but AT-server is tempting now that you mention it
    [VIP] AMß?A?ITUS: @raexas absolutely, but it might take a while
    [VIP] AMß?A?ITUS: collaborating with a producer in Australia is quite tedious, especially with stems and such
    Apple?coke: Listen!!

    DAST: !DANGER ZONE!
    Vladimir Bla Bla: I'm nervous
    [Español]
    Vladimir Bla Bla: is my first time
    [Español]
    DAST: Ike i'm ready to see you pump out teh jammzz
    Ike Productions: lol
    DAST: PUMP IT UP BRO
    Ike Productions: i cant wait till i finish my electro track haha
    DAST: That one with the cool bassline?
    Ike Productions: yeah
    Ike Productions: the deadmau5 one
    DAST: yea that one was pretty sick
    DAST: I'm gonna be working on Danger Zone for a while
    DAST: until it sounds like complete brostep haha
    Ike Productions: ha
    Ike Productions: were taking over chat
    DAST: I don't think anyone else is talking
    Your friend Crylast [EA] just joined the room!
    Ike Productions: yeah haha
    DAST: Cool people are looking at monstercat stuff
    DAST: You still trying to get on there? With this next one i think you got a shot
    Ike Productions: yeah i was thinking about sending that in to monstercat
    DAST: Personally I'm trying to get on "Never Say Die". Eptic/Zomboy style brotha!
    Ike Productions: theyve been releasing a lot of electro lately have you heard the newest one?
    DAST: who? Monstercat?
    Ike Productions: yeah
    DAST: yea idk, i don't keep up much with them
    DAST: But i've turned from a electro producer into a dubstep producer rather quickly haha
    Ike Productions: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC4NdLg_05c
    DAST: sick stuff
    DAST: you gotta have fairly high level stuff to be on there
    Ike Productions: i think i have a chance with this new song though
    DAST: Yea man, it sounded good. Get some vocals on it...it'll make it sell easier
    Ike Productions: yeah for sure
    DAST: If the vocals are good and not autotuned crap you can make a release similar to zedd's new one
    DAST: and maybe i'll make a complextro drop if you need me to ;)
    Ike Productions: i might actually but i might need it to be non lucky date
    DAST: My newer stuff has been a little bit less lucky dateish
    Ike Productions: more deadmau5 style o
    DAST: I've gone to crazy Eptic/Mord Fustangness
    DAST: .)
    DAST: ;) *
    Ike Productions: ive noticed haha
    DAST: I like it a lot. That real Grimey and just nasty sound
    DAST: But not all mechanical like Datsik/Excision (as much as i like them)
    Ike Productions: yeah
    Maria8: Wdkj ahora willingness holi._.xd
    [Kiswahili]
    DAST: i've pretty much given up on the thought of making dutch house
    Ike Productions: haha dutch synths are so easy
    DAST: as easy as it is, there is just no heart in it. I like the sound, but it's too quick of a project. You can make a dutch drop in like 30 minutes
    Ike Productions: yeah true
    DAST: And i don't feel like being some guy pumping out a crappy dutch mix every 3 days
    DAST: I rather pump out a crappy dubstep mix every week ;)
    Ike Productions: lol
    Ike Productions: you should apply for beta testing
    Ike Productions: for 6.5
    DAST: nah
    Ike Productions: because thats what i wrote the electro song on
    DAST: I don't want to download the new sound bank and stuff
    Ike Productions: theres no new sound bank
    DAST: Too much stuff.
    Ike Productions: just copy over the old sound bank to the 6.5 folder
    DAST: I don't even use the soundbank
    DAST: but yea
    Ike Productions: me either
    DAST: I feel like that's cheating
    DAST: although i somehow have no problem using lucky date refills haha
    Ike Productions: hahaha
    Ike Productions: he should make a default refill for reason
    DAST: The way i look at it, so many people use the reason soundbank so if you use it, your going to make it sound like a reason song. If you use a lucky date refill, no one knows
    ? E-Step: bewbz
    DAST: AND HOLY CRAP...TITTIES
    Ike Productions: lol
    AudioSlam: 0_0

    Ike Productions: hahha
    DAST: What part of this is Knife part
    DAST: because i think that's probably what i like. I've always thought that SHM is a little poopy.
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: back
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: oh cool
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: SHM
    Ike Productions: cant hear the song over the gun shots.. haha. they should have synced em with the song
    Maria8: And Pa wn Get into someone's conversation Able Chilean or Spanish: c
    [Español]
    DAST: love the guy just gettin' shot in the face. That's what you get for dressing up like a skeleton at a strip club. Dont they know they could've gotten a lapdance instead of this fighting?
    Ike Productions: haha
    Ike Productions: wooo
    DAST: haha i love all the people with their volume muted just blindly muting
    DAST: wooting*
    DAST: like all at once everyone woots
    Ike Productions: -_-
    Ike Productions: haha
    DAST: freakin' ridiculous.
    Ike Productions: i still think there is too much bass in this
    Buddha: it cuz every one uses auto woot
    DAST: Yea it's kinda muffled at the beginning
    Ike Productions: auto woot?
    DAST: is auto woot an app or something?
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: nope
    Buddha: extension '
    DAST: wow, that's kinda dumb.
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: you have to make your own script or find a good one
    Buddha: or just use google
    DAST: if everyone is doing that, then what's the point of even sharing your music?
    DAST: Everyone is sharing their music so that no one can hear it haha
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: people autowoot to get points
    DAST: but what's stopping them from autowooting on mute in the waitlist so they can share their song?
    DAST: it's stupid
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: it's the internet
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: most everything is stupid
    Ike Productions: lol
    DAST: but i just know that most people aren't here
    Buddha: there afkb
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: i listen to music all day
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: i have an autowoot
    Buddha: do mean there not listening to the music '
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: people have it for when they are slepping
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: *sleeping
    ? E-Step: ^
    DAST: ahh doubt it
    ? E-Step: @UnëãrthëdTRU7H Your getting pretty close to 10k
    DAST: i guess this would be cool if i was playing starcraft or something
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: @? E-Step i know
    DAST: to have an ongoing playlist
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: I listen whilst gaming
    DAST: I just came in because ike was playing his song that he made
    Ike Productions: ^_^
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: internet points make the world go round
    DAST: yea i guess
    DAST: But you must admit, there is at least 1/3 of the people here not listening
    DAST: just waiting to play their song
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: less then that
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: most of the basement visitors are from europe
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: People doing other things while listening
    Ike Productions: i love teh wobbles in this
    DAST: okay lets say 1/5. You think that might be correct?
    DAST: yea this song is pretty sick
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: 2/10
    DAST: 2/10 is 1/5
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: No matter how much I love this app I'm not going to sit here and stare at the screen
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: I drop in from time to time
    Buddha: you could be cooking eating gaming doing Homework auto woot has its uses
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: ty all
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: ^
    DAST: Yea, i'm just trying to kinda prove my point
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: Well you can't
    DAST: that it has a small fault
    DAST: I know personally sometimes i've muted and just wooted if i get sick of listening to music for like 40 minutes straight and the room is packed
    DAST: so i can imaging others would do the same
    DAST: imagine*
    Ike Productions: haha yeah
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: so stop vcomplaining if you would do the same thing
    DAST: i'm not complaining
    DAST: just observing
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: i disagree
    Buddha: ^
    DAST: disagree with my observation? Or think i'm complaining.
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: you are complaiing
    DAST: Because I wouldn't just flat out tell you i'd do the same if I was complaining...that would be idiotic.
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: *complaining
    Buddha: complaining.
    DAST: I'm just trying to prove my point. That others would be doing the same
    AudioSlam: look on the brightside at least people dont "auto meh"
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: The way I see it, there are 40 or so people in here listening to music together, and going about their business
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: ^
    Buddha: you can auto meh
    DAST: haha only a dick would automeh
    Buddha: but i know of no one that uses it
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: ^i ban those
    DAST: i mean...unless someone really just didn't like music
    Ike Productions: auto meh? lol
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: automeh is a whole different subject
    DAST: MEH
    DAST: MEH
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: See I played a track from a room user, and 2 people added it, and he's not even here.
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: spam is also a bannable offence
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: Proves it's worth
    DAST: Yea I'm just saying
    DAST: 1/5 people are probably abusing the system
    AudioSlam: ^^^lol
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: It's working as intended
    DAST: It was an observation and i wanted to see if people agree
    DAST: but apparently people don't see it the way i do.
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: You seem to be the only one worried about votes
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: That's just my observation
    DAST: i'm not
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: I'm here to listen to the music
    DAST: i just think it's a false representation. If I was to play a song of mine here, would i be playing for 40 people? No, more like 25-30
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: i could care less as long as people don't fight, people play electronic music in here and i have music
    DAST: as a producer who wants to share his music, it's frustrating. That's what i'm getting at.
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: Well play some
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: If people like it they will add it
    AudioSlam: watch out we got a badass over here
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: play your song
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: just b/c people autowoot doesn't mean you have to be man, that's just stupid
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: *mean
    DAST: i'm not being mean?
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: not being mean
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: but ranting of sorta
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: even if people are autowooting, the ones who are active at the time will surely let it be known in chat.
    Ike Productions: he's just trying to state a point how is that mean?
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: *sorts
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: that the song is bad
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: @Ike Productions wrong word choice
    Vladimir Bla Bla: is my first time
    [Español]
    Vladimir Bla Bla: [:
    [Español]
    DAST: it's a valid point, no need to get your panties in a bunch
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: =)
    Ike Productions: @UnëãrthëdTRU7H oh lol
    DAST: Mr Mod of a internet thing with like 30 people. The ropes you must have climbed to get to be that...
    DAST: fuck it, i'm out
    Buddha: later
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: Lots of times I don't like a song, but the video is cool
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: i'm quite confused why you are mad at people wanting internet points oer your song...
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: but you left so it doesn't matter
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: As you were
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: =p
    Ike Productions: if you were a producer you'd understand.. i get what he's saying but at least they are listening
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: >.>
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: That's what I was trying to explain to him
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: I played one of Whitepopes and he isn't here and 2 people added it
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: That's pretty cool
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: people listening to your song is way different then ranting(of sorts) over an autowoot
    ?.?ll?.Sanctions.?ll??: So if that goes so on and so on, it could add up quite a bit
    ? E-Step: id rather see a bunch of auto woots than a bunch of mehs
    UnëãrthëdTRU7H: agreed
    DAST: FUCK. TITS. CUNT. SHIT. POOP
